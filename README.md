Yapc is yet another file sharing site inspired by pomf.
The frontend is written using svelte and tailwind and the backend is written using Go.
It is simplistic by design and is designed to be fast, easy to use and easy to maintain.

#### Deployment and setup

Since the backend was written in Go it is very easy to create your own instance.
Read the [docs](https://github.com/hexahigh/yapc/blob/main/docs/installation.md) for more information.

#### Running with Docker compose

To run the backend and frontend using docker compose you can use the example docker-compose.yml file found in this repo.
